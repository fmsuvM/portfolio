      "What if you had a magical tool that could draw a three-dimensional and delicate picture just like swiping a brush like a painter? We solve this with a light-weight tinting and VR system.",
      "Light painting is a technique in which a camera draws a picture by moving a light source during long exposures. Content using this technique is Happy Birthday MoonYeon! It has an iPad on the lid of the festival and a long exposure to reveal a birthday cake. There is also Making Future Magic that makes characters appear to be moving using the same mechanism. There are also other techniques that are light-handed, leaving a sense of ambiguity. In this way, the light weight is highly flexible and can be described in various ways. However, drawing or becoming more complicated becomes more difficult.",
      "We developed the future tool \"MIRAITO PEINT\", which makes it easy to light-link even shapes, three-dimensional, complicated and large-sized objects. We use the Millite Point to provide an indirect experience of virtual reality without the use of head-mounted tissues."

      "This work aims at \"using transparency in reality\". We decided to use a water-absorbing polymer (deodorant beads) to make it transparent in water. When the water-absorbing polymer absorbs water, the longer the time, the larger the size. Utilizing the fact that the size changes with the time difference, water was absorbed at various times to produce a water-absorbing polymer of random size. Since the water-absorbing polymer has almost the same refractive index as water, it is almost invisible in water. However, although the outline looks a little shining due to the reflection of light, this is also an expression that makes the viewer think that there is something. Utilizing the subtlety and the random size of the salty plum, the invisible thing became visible the moment it became transparent. ing.

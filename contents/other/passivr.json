      "It has been reported that deskwork using computers while sitting for a long time, such as that performed by engineers and designers, places a heavy burden on the body and has an adverse effect. Therefore, it is recommended to stand at regular intervals to reduce the burden on the body, and to optimize the height of the chair and desk to improve the posture of the individual. However, many desk workers do not adjust the height of chairs or desks, and they sit unconsciously for a long time in a posture where they can easily work, so spontaneous improvement is difficult.",
      "We propose PassiVR, which reduces the burden on the body by encouraging workers to improve their posture and take a break during long desk work. PassiVR is a desktop robot that integrates an HMD and a robot arm. When a user sits down, PassiVR moves to a position where the user's body is less burdened. By looking into the HMD part of PassiVR, the user can work in a posture with less burden on the body. In addition, PassiVR starts to move slowly to the position that gives the best posture when the user is leaning forward or leaning on a chair, or in a posture that places a burden on the body."

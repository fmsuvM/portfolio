      "The spread of general-purpose head-mounted displays (HMDs) such as Oculus go and PSVR has made it possible for individuals to experience experiences such as VR Chat and Virtual Youtuber. However, it is difficult for users to experience VR content for a long time because they experience visual fatigue and sickness. Therefore, the non-wearing time is longer than the HMD wearing time. In addition, since the design of the housing of the HMD does not change, it is not possible to grasp the content of the content to be experienced from the appearance.",
      "We propose HuManoiD, an interactive robot whose appearance can be changed, by combining the HMD when it is not mounted and its controller. HuManoiD is activated by placing the HMD and controller on a dedicated stand, and interacts with the user. In addition, the VR content to be experienced is determined by customizing the appearance of HuManoiD with special parts, and it communicates with the user by acting in conjunction with the content. In this paper, we show the implementation of HuManoiD, the three prototyped applications, and the evaluation of the user, and discuss and discuss the HMD design without wearing."

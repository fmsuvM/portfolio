      "Book Roof is a book stand dedicated to placing books face down. Pages that have been read halfway are preserved by laying them face down, and by placing them on Book Roof, they become a \"roof\" and do not impair the appearance. Book Roof also serves as a reading light. When reading is interrupted, the light goes out, and when reading is resumed, the light turns on according to the surrounding darkness. It focuses on the unconscious act of \"putting a book down.\""
      "Book Roof is made of acrylic plate cut with a laser cutter. By using a laser cutter, Book Roof becomes a bookstand for various book sizes (paperbacks, new books, etc.). In addition, even if a part is broken, it is not necessary to buy it again, and only the broken part is cut out with a laser cutter and reassembled.

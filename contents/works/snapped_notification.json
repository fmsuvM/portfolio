    "This system allows not only the photographer but also the person in the photograph to have the photograph. When the photographer takes a picture, the subject value (the possibility that a certain subject is reflected) is calculated. Notify that the subject was photographed based on the subject value and share the photograph. A system for resolving the inconsistency of belonging to a photograph, in which the photographer is the photographer (other person) while the photographer is himself.",

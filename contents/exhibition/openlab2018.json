      "JusTap is a smart faucet without the Handle. JusTap identifies individuals and things and personalizes water with just the right amount, just the right warmth and no waste. Beyond \"automatically\". This project was exhibited in Open Laboratory as exUI in 2018.",
      "I also worked as a manager of a joint research area with Mitsubishi at the exhibition. I managed discussions and schedules to show the product better."
